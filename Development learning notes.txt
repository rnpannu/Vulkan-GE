Development learning notes

ctrl+shift+b = build all

f5 = launch debugger (up to breakpoint if called after placing breakpoint, stops build process here)

f11 = step into code at breakpoint
	f11 steps into code line by line, and you can hover over variables to see their value at that time in execution.

f10 = step over lines in debugging


TODO:

Make these notes into an actual better structured document?
	- Might be nice to have learning journey documentation for interview questions

of runtime.
