Development learning notes

ctrl+shift+b = build all

f5 = launch debugger (up to breakpoint if called after placing breakpoint, stops build process here)

f11 = step into code at breakpoint
	f11 steps into code line by line, and you can hover over variables to see their value at that time in execution.

f10 = step over lines in debugging


TODO:

Make these notes into an actual better structured document?
	- Might be nice to have learning journey documentation for interview questions

Learned about the importance of logging and assertions for debugging and set up a basic handler for these. 

Small Notes
Want to learn more about memory allocation as described in episode 3 at 16 minutes. Allocation with memset on the stack is
better than dynamic allocation on the (heap?) with malloc? This will generate and 0 fill the array at compile time instead
of runtime.

SOLVED - Error on logger.h and logger.c about log_output KAPI function - .vscode defines had an error

SOLVED - Error on # sign in expr in asserts.h - Structure of #define macros

a function declared 'dllimport' may not be definedC/C++(904)
